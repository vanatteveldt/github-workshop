# Removing sensitive files

We all know the problem: you accidentally commit a file you really shouldn't have added to github. 
For example, it can contain a password or private key, or can contain private or copyrighted data you are not allowed to share.
Of course, you can `git rm` the file, and it will not appear on the default github site anymore, 
but it will still be there in the commit history.  So, how to completely erase a file from a git(hub) repository?

# Scenario 1: You added and/or committed the file, but did not push yet

# Scenario 2: You just pushed the commit containing the sensitive file

# Scenario 3: The sensitive file has been in the repository for a while
